    <h1>Side Projects</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I have a idea that I want to try out, so I just start up a new git repository... and months later I'm still working on it. Here's a short list of some of the highlights. For a complete list, check out my <a href="https://github.com/dfridovi">git profile</a>.</p>

    <h2>FaSTrack</h2>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07373">FaSTrack</a> (Fast and Safe Tracking) is a new approach to real time trajectory planning that preserves a modular safety guarantee. I've been working on several <a href="research.html">extensions</a> to it, but in the process I decided to go ahead and build a nice, clean, open-source ROS implementation of the original version. That's <a href="https://hjreachability.github.io/fastrack/">fastrack</a>! Be warned... it may or may not abuse C++ templates.</p>

    <h2>Dumbo</h2>
    <p>I've been playing chess since I was in kindergarten, and back in elementary school I used to play competitively. I started getting back into chess a couple years ago and got my rating back up to about 1750, so I thought it would be fun to make a chess engine.... but that turned out to be a bit more work than I expected. So instead, I built <a href="https://dfridovi.github.io/dumbo/">dumbo</a>, which is an abstract, templated C++ library implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (and a cool little tic tac toe demo). Check it out if you like!</p>

    <h2>Mininet</h2>
    <p>I realized that I was going to lots of deep learning-related talks, and sitting next to a lot of folks who use neural nets all the time, and yet I'd never actually played with them myself. So I built <a href="https://dfridovi.github.io/mininet/">mininet</a>, which is a lightweight C++ library for deep learning. Currently, it only supports simple, feed-forward networks, but hey, if you'd like add more functionality please do submit a PR!</p>

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is a pretty hot area of robotics research these days, so I thought should learn a bit about it and try out some of the classic algorithms myself. <a href="https://dfridovi.github.io/rl/">rl</a> is a templated, abstract C++ library for reinforcement learning.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="orange">
    <h2>Gaussian Processes</h2>
    <p>Another popular tool in robotics research these days is the Gaussian Process framework for function approximation. <a href="https://dfridovi.github.io/gp/">gp</a> is a lightweight C++ library for Gaussian Processes.</p>
